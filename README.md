# Automating Attendance System using Face-Recognition-with-Masks

## Abstract

## Action Plan

## Phase 1: Face Recognition

### 1.1 Face Verification vs Face Recognition

### Verification
Face verification is quite simple. We can take our FaceID for example which we use to unlock our phone or at the airport when scanning our passport and verifying if it is really us. So it works in 2 steps:

- **We input the image or the ID of a person.**
- **We output whether the image ir ID is that of the claimed person.**

It is a ```1:1``` problem. We expect to have a high accuracy of the face verification system - ```>99%``` - so that it can further be used into the face recognition system.

### Face Recognition
Face recognition is much harder than face verification. It is used mainly for attendance system in offices, or when facebook automatically tags your friend. The process is as such:

- **We have a database of K persons.**
- **We take the image of a person.**
- **We output the ID if the image is any of the K persons or if it is not.**

Face recognition is a ```1:K``` problem where K is the number of persons in our database.

### The One Shot Learning Dilemma
The problem with the face recognition for automating the attendance system at RT Knits is to be able for the neural network to recognize a particular person from only **one** image. Since we are going to have only one picture of the employees, the system should be able to recognize the person again. 

Suppose we have 100 employees then one simple solution would be to take this one image and feed it into a CNN and and output a softmax unit with 101 outputs(100 outputs is for the employees and the one left is to indicate none). However, this would not work well for two reasons:

1. We will have a very little training set hence, we will not be able to train a robust neural network.
2. Suppose we have another employee joining in then we would have to increment our outputs and re-train our Conv-Net.

### 3.1 FaceNet
FaceNet is a deep neural network used for extracting features from an image of a personâ€™s face. It was developed in 2015 by three researchers at Google: Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin.
